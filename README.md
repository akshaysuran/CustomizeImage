Image can be customized using properties on an Image composable (contentScale, colorFilter).

In this Project, I created different Composable sets to customize the Image drawing on Canvas. 

###[ContentScale]: To crop or change how an image is scaled inside the bound

###[Clip]: Clip modifier to crop image into a shape like Circle, RoundedCornerShape

###[border]: border surrounding the image, it can work with [Clip]

### Using Brush API to draw a gradient border, It is closer to the hardware layer which we can customize.

[ColorFilter]: To add tint in the source image. Can use blend mode with the given color onto our source image composable.
